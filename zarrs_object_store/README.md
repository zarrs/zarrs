[`object_store`](https://crates.io/crates/object_store) store support for the [`zarrs`](https://crates.io/crates/zarrs) Rust crate.

```rust
use zarrs_storage::AsyncReadableWritableListableStorage;
use zarrs_object_store::AsyncObjectStore;

let options = object_store::ClientOptions::new().with_allow_http(true);
let store = object_store::http::HttpBuilder::new()
    .with_url("http://...")
    .with_client_options(options)
    .build()?;
let store: AsyncReadableWritableListableStorage =
    Arc::new(AsyncObjectStore::new(store));
```

## Version Compatibility Matrix
See [doc/version_compatibility_matrix.md](./doc/version_compatibility_matrix.md).

`object_store` is re-exported as a dependency of this crate, so it does not need to be specified as a direct dependency.
You can enable `object_store` features `fs`, `aws`, `azure`, `gcp` and `http` by enabling features for this crate of the same name.

However, if `object_store` is a direct dependency, it is necessary to ensure that the version used by this crate is compatible.
This crate can depend on a range of semver-incompatible versions of `object_store`, and Cargo will not automatically choose a single version of `object_store` that satisfies all dependencies.
Use a precise cargo update to ensure compatibility.
For example, if this crate resolves to `object_store` 0.11.1 and your code uses 0.10.2:
```shell
cargo update --package object_store:0.11.1 --precise 0.10.2
```
